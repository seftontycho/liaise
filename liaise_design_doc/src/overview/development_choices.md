# Development Choices

This section will discuss the development choices that have been made so far in the development of Liaise.

## Language

Liaise is being developed in the Rust programming language. Rust was chosen for its safety, performance, and expressiveness. Rust's strong type system and ownership model make it easy to write safe and efficient code, while its expressive syntax makes it easy to write clean and readable code.

It is also worth noting that the game is being developed in Rust because the developers are familiar with the language and enjoy working with it.

## Engine

Bevy is being used as the game engine for Liaise. Primarily because it is the most mature and feature-rich game engine available for Rust. It's data-driven architecture and ECS (Entity Component System) design make it perfect for a performance-critical game like Liaise.
