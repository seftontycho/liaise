# Genre and Target Audience

Liaise is a mix of three genres:

- Puzzle
- Strategy
- Simulation

### Target Audience

The game is designed to appeal to players who enjoy programming, puzzles, and strategy games.

The game is designed to be accessible to those with prior programming experience.

Whilst the easier levels will be accessible to those with little to no knowledge or Rust due to the complexity of the latter levels, it is recommended that the player has some experience with the language.

Knowledge of distributed systems is not required as this game is designed to be self exploration of the concepts. Research into the more complicated consensus algorithms may be required to complete the game.
