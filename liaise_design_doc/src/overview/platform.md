# Platform

Liaise is designed to be played on desktop computers running Windows, macOS, or Linux. The game will be distributed through cargo, the Rust package manager, and will be available for download from the [crates.io](https://crates.io) website.

Packaging the game as a Rust crate will allow players to easily install and update the game using the `cargo install` and `cargo update` commands. This will make it easy for players to keep the game up to date with the latest features and bug fixes.

### Future Platforms

In the future we will consider taking the game to the web. This will allow players to play the game in their browser without having to download and install it. This will make the game more accessible to players who do not have access to a desktop computer.

To do this we will take inspiration from Rust Playground, an online tool that allows users to write and run Rust code in their browser.
