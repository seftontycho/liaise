# Player Experience

The player will control multiple identical drones in a finite 2D grid-based environment. The drones are autonomous and will move according to the code that the player writes.

Each level will have a specific goal that the player must achieve. This could be anything from collecting resources, reaching a specific location, to decrypting a message.

The player must complete these levels in the face of ever growing constraints. These constraints could be anything from limited resources, to network partitions, to the drones themselves being unreliable.

## Unique Features

Unlike other games in the genre, the key difference in Liaise is that there is no direct control over the drones. The player must write code to control the drones, and the drones will execute this code autonomously.

Every drone is an exact copy of the others, and the player must write code that will work for all of them. This means that the player must write code that is robust and can handle any situation that may arise.
